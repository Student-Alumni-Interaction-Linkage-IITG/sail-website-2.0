          The Graduation Tea Party is a refined and celebratory gathering held
          to honor and congratulate graduates on their accomplishments. This
          event is designed as an elegant, relaxed occasion where graduates can
          come together with peers, faculty, and alumni to reflect on their
          academic journey, share stories, and enjoy a moment of recognition
          before embarking on their post-graduation paths.
