                  Each year, as a heartfelt farewell to the graduating class, We
                  release the Class Song, a cherished tradition at IITG. This
                  special song serves as a musical tribute to the unforgettable
                  journey of the graduating students, capturing the essence of
                  their time on campus. In a moving ceremony, all members of the
                  graduating class come together, hand in hand, to sing the
                  song, celebrating the friendships, memories, and milestones
                  theyâ€™ve achieved over the years. The Class Song is more than
                  just a melody; it symbolizes the unity, growth, and shared
                  experiences of the students, marking the end of an era and the
                  beginning of new adventures. This tradition not only
                  strengthens the bond among classmates but also leaves a
                  lasting legacy, allowing them to carry the spirit of IITG with
                  them as they step into the world beyond.

                  Alumni Greet is a heartwarming initiative by the Student
                  Alumni Interaction Linkage (SAIL) aimed at welcoming freshers
                  to their new college life. Through self-shot videos, alumni
                  share their experiences, memories, and advice, offering a
                  personal touch to the hostel orientation. These videos, played
                  during the orientation, help bridge the gap between current
                  students and alumni, addressing common doubts about campus
                  life, academics, and hostel living. By sharing their journeys
                  and successes, alumni inspire and motivate freshers, making
                  them feel a part of a larger, supportive community. This
                  initiative not only reduces the anxiety of new students but
                  also fosters a strong sense of belonging and pride in their
                  institute.
